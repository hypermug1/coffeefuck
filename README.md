# coffeefuck
A bot from hell. Crafted with human sacrifice.

## Logging into the account and starting the code
In `coffeefuck.py` there is a line of code that reads from .env to login and start the bot. Create a file called `.env` (cannot be anything else) and start with this:  
```TOKEN=```  
Next, Go to discord.com/developers and copy your bot token. Then we should insert the bot token like this:  
```TOKEN=bot token goes here```  
Save the file.  

## Starting the bot.
The bot runs via the `coffeefuck.py` file which loads commands from the `cogs` folder.

## Meme generator not working
The meme generator uses another project. Modify https://github.com/hemchander23/commandline_meme_generator to work with your setup. This only works on Linux servers.
## MY BOT DOESN'T MATCH YOURS?? WHY????
I don't update this too frequently. And when I do, you have to reflect the changes in your code.

## What can I do with this?
Basically whatever you want. I have the WTFPL license.
